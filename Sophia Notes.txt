1. Website needs to look good/professional. 

2. The homepage needs to have 3 things: link to our twitter. link to our discord. "mint coming soon" mark

3. There needs to be an "minting" page that has the specific information related to mint day logistics. 
This includes the following information to be designed and shown however you want:
•	1024 Unique Crip-To Hood Apes are being generated
•	All will belong to a different crypto gang, ie. eth, solana, btc
•	Every 5th ape minted minted will come with a free ape
•	The presale will be small, only allowing about 100 apes to be minted
•	Minting gas will be dirt cheap, $30/mint

4. There needs to be a "lore" page 
that has information about the collection explaining what the different things mean about the apes. For example, tells readers about the face-tats etc. 
That info is all up right now, and looks terrible.

5. There need to be tons of pictures of different apes all over. 
I have about 50 different pictures, you can put whichever ones you want wherever, I'll share the folder with you. Just I don't want a ton of whitespace.


Notes:
On the minting page I also added a carousel if you wanted to use that. I didn't want to throw off the layout though.
